# About Us

According to GitHub’s “State of the Octoverse” report 2019, **99%** of software projects in the world use Open Source Technologies in some way or the other. Open source has undoubtably changed the world, and we, the JODC *(JIIT Open-Source Developers Circle)* aim to help students to become a part of it.

The JODC is an initiative by the students of JIIT-128 to promote open source culture. The hub is all about contributing to and collaborating on projects, networking, learning together and guiding students.

We conduct talks, workshops, activities, one-to-one sessions and dev-sprints to mentor students. We encourage them to volunteer for open source projects and organisations and participate in open source initiatives such as Google Summer of Code and Outreachy to become better developers and for the betterment of open source.

Join us at our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/jiitodc/permalink/625576687984277/) and [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yETyUJb) to connect with us and get to know about all our upcoming activities.
